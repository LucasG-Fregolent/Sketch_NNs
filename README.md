# Sketch NNs
TODO: 
* Improve ResNet
* Create submodule to import images from computer
  * Pass the image to a classifier to determine if it is a Neural Network sketch or not
  * If so:
      * Pass it to a pre-trained network (e.g ResNet 50)
* Web app with Gradio (or flask, but no paralellization of operations on oter threads with flask, neither asynchronous operations)
* Insert pre-trained models for transfer learning
